# KD0RC_Flexicraft_Utility
Flex 6000/8000 radio utility to provide control over Flex output power when using an Elecraft amplifier.

The primary function of this utility is to change the output of the Flex
so that it does not overdrive an Elecraft KPA 500.  It provides 10 settings
per band; one for each mode with and without the amp.
  
The utility also provides control for the KPA 500 and KAT 500.  This makes 
managing the amp and tuner very easy, especially when operating remotely.
 
This utility makes use of Flexlib, so you won't see text-based API calls
here.
